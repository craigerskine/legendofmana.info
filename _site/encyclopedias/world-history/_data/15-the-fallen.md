Wyrms are rumored to be Flammies who have fallen into another world. Powerful mages summoned them into this world. Wyrms possess the incredible powers of the Flammies, but they lack their nobility and grandeur. True Flammies are said to appear regal and divine, unlike dragons and wyrms, but no man can truthfully claim to have seen them.
