The Great Witch Anise was the first mage to go down in history. Anis bored a hole into the Mana Tree and built her laboratory there. The flow of Mana into both human and Faerie worlds was diverted. Anise constructed a jewel called the Eye of Flame using the vast amounts of Mana in her laboratory. The Firestone brought out the evil of whoever touched it.
