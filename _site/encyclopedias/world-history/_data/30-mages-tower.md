The mages started building towers at Mana Points all over Fa'Diel in order to regain the Eyes of Flame. They took action against the Faeries, who stood in the way of their plans. Whenever a tower was built, an army would come to destroy it. Such wars continued for hundreds of years. Soon, all of humanity came to think of Faeries as evil beings.
