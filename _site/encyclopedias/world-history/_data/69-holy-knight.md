The chivalric code, which Ricrot IV established, produced many legendary heroes in a short time period. Julio Liotte was the most accomplished knight in the empire's army, and thus he was given the title of 'Holy Knight,' and became the guardian of the empire. The Liotte family passed this title down the line.
