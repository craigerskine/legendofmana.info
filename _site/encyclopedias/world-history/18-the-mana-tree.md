The Mana Tree sustained the bond between the world of humans and of Faeries. Plants exist in both the human and Faerie dimensions. They absorb the Mana of Fa'Diel and release it into the atmosphere. Humans use trees for fuel and tools, harnessing their power within inanimate objects. Faeries use the Mana released by plants to make Fa'Diel a better place.
