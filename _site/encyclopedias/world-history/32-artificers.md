There were two types of magical beings. One type was imbued with life. Another type had hidden powers. The latter were called artifacts. Artifacts had weaker magical powers than Eyes of Flame, but were simpler to construct. Creating Eyes of Flame was frought with accidents, so making artifacts became the most popular kind of magic.
