Anuella saw through the mage's plot. She left the northern mountain, then gave life to a rocky hill so the mage's caravan could not progress further. The living hill called itself Gaeus, and its knowledge seemed deeper, and more vast than Anuella's. Anuella called for Gaeus' help and prepared for war.
