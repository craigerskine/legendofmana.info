Head back to the main room to take the elevator:

After the battle, pick up the key and go back into the Elevator. Go to the 2nd Floor and follow these instructions:

Go back to the Elevator and go to the 1st Floor. Search the Lower Left stool and enter the Elevator again. Go to the 3rd Floor and head Left to fight Deathbringer.
