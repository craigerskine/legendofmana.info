Enter *Domina*. Go to the Park with the Fountain and talk to Diddle. He'll leave the screen; follow him and then re-enter the Park and talk to Capella. Leave the screen, go to the Outskirts of *Domina* (far left point), and come back to the Park to talk to Capella again. Follow him to the center of town and talk to the Sproutling.

Go to the Inn(the upper left door in the center of *Domina*) and listen to the conversation. Talk to Miss Yuka and then go to the Outskirts of *Domina* (that far left point on the *Domina* Map). Listen to the conversation with the Mail Pelican. Go to the World Map and then return to the Outskirts of *Domina* again. Talk to the Mail Pelican and she'll tell you to go to the Highway.

Enter *Luon Highway*, and go to the second fork:

* Right
* Right
* Lower Right
* Right

There will be a letter at the fork in the path. Tell Capella to read it and go to the Lower Left, and then Left to find Diddle. Tell him that Capella read the Letter. Go into the caves and use these directions:

* Lower Left
* Lower Left
* Talk to Capella
* Upper Left

Fight the Giga Rex and after the the battle you get a Gator Skin(keep it for a later Event).
