Enter *Geo*. Find the bar area and talk to Niccolo. Have him join your party.

Enter the *Ulkan Mines* and go into Watts' Workshop. Exit and re-enter the Workshop. Watts will ask for that Gator Skin that I told you to keep. Go back with a Gator Skin and give it to him. If you don't have one, go to the Inn in *Domina* and talk to Miss Yuka. Re-enter the Workshop to end the Event.
