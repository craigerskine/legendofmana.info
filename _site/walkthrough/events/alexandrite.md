Enter *Domina*. Go to the bar and talk to Elazul. Agree to take Pearl to *Geo*.

Enter *Geo* and go talk to Diana at Kristie's place. Tell Pearl everything is okay and talk to Kristie. Now you'll need to collect 3 keys and here's how:

* Go to Mephianse's office in the Academy of Magic
* Go to the City's gates
* Go to the Instrument Shop
* Go back to Kristie's Place to find Diana missing. Head to the Underground Battle Arena to find her.
