Enter *Gato Grottoes*.

Go to the Dreamweaving. Depending on who you chose to side with in the previous Events you will need to have that person join your party. After the scene, talk to the person you sided with (I chose Daena) to have them join and then talk to Matilda to get the Brooch of Love AF.

Place the Brooch of Love AF in the space directly to the Right of the *Jungle* to create *Lucemia*. Enter *Lucemia*.

Head to area 30 on the map of *Lucemia* to get to Irwin.

Defeat Irwin to end the final Event with Escad and company.
