Enter *Domina*. Go to the church and talk to the Inspector. Tell him "No, that can't be," and he'll ask you to go to *Geo* to find the Jumi Cores. When you get to *Geo* enter and then leave the jewel shop right away to see Pearl and Elazul enter. Now, search the treasure box on the right to get transported to Pandora's Box. After the conversation, choose either Pearl or Elazul to join you and leave *Geo* to return to the World Map.

Place Jumi's Staff AF in the space directly to the Left of *Domina* to create the Bejeweled City. Enter the *Bejewled City*.

Enter all the rooms in the Glowing Corridor to get the four gemstones, (Sapphire, Topaz, Emerald, and Ruby). To fight the first Jewel Beast head towards Sappho's gate and search the door. After the battle, place two gemstones in the slots and search the door until you hear 2 tones(the number of tones that you hear is equal to the number of correct gemstones you placed in the holders; keep trying different stones until you find the right combination) to open the gate but do not pass through yet. Return to the gemstones rooms again to get back the gems you just placed.

Go through Sappho's gate to get to level 2. On this tier you will find the Amethyst and Aquamarine gemstones. Search the Gate on this level and you will encounter another Jewel Beast. Defeat it to proceed. After the battle, go to Sappho's gate again and place three gemstones in the slots until you hear 3 tones (just like you did on level 1). The gate will then be open and you can enter the 3rd level. Be sure to go back and re-stock the gems that you placed in the three slots.

On level 3 you will find the Diamond gem in the room near the stairs. You must defeat the Machine Golem to get it though. Search the gate on this level to fight another Jewel Beast. After that battle you need to place 4 gems in the slots to until you hear 4 tones (just like you did on level 2). The gate will open and you can proceed to the Room of Clarius..

Defeat the Lord of Jewels 999 and Lord of Jewels 1000 and watch the scenes to complete this event.
