When you leave your house after completing your first Event, you will trigger this Event. After the little conversation, enter *Domina*.

On the *Domina* Map head to the point at the far left. This will take you to the Outskirts of *Domina*. Proceed to the upper left of this area and you will see a cool looking pumpkin patch and two sorcerers.

Battle the two kids and dodge their magical attacks. After the battle tell Bud that you want him to be your apprentice.
