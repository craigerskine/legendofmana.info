*Note:* If you're going to do "The Seven Wisdoms" quest, it is imperative that you take Bud (that dude from the Little Sorcerers Event) with you on this one. (This will trigger the Seven Wisdoms Event but that is ok, don't worry about finishing it until later.)

Place the Bottled Spirit AF in the space directly to the Right of the *Mindas Ruins* to create the *Ulkan Mines*. Enter the *Ulkan Mines*.

Follow these directions to navigate through this Event:

* Go Right
* Enter the Top Room to get to Watt's Workshop
* Talk to Pokiehl to begin looking for Watts
* Leave the Workshop and go to the Lower Right
* Go Down the Stairs and into the next area
* Go to the Lower Left corner and Down the Stairs
* Go to the Upper Left
* Go to the Upper Left
* Go to the Upper Left and then Up the Stairs
* Go Down the Path to find your way to Watts
* Talk to Watts three times and you will be attacked

Defeat the monster to end this event.
