Enter the *SS Buccaneer*.

Go see Ramtieger and tell him to go South, South, West. Tell the Captain you will agree to go to *Fieg Snowfields* to get the faeries's treasure.

Enter the *Fieg Snowfields*. Go to the Fields of Innocence and talk to Fiorentina to have a spell cast on you to let you see level 2 faeries. Follow these directions:

* Upper Left
* Lower Left
* Down
* Right to have Malbarasta cast the level 3 faeries spell
* Lower Right
* Lower Right
* Right
* Upper Right to have Tilda cast level 5 faeries spell
* Upper Right
* Upper Left
* Lower Left
* Talk to Secret (the one who won't reveal her name) to see all the faeries
* Right
* Right (SAVE YOUR GAME AT THE STATUE)
* Lower Right
* Right

You can speak to only 1 of the 3 faeries in this area; if you speak to the wrong one, you'll fail the Event (that's why I told you save your game before). Choose a faerie, talk to it, and cross your fingers. If you guess right you finish the Event, if not, load your save game and try again.
