Note: This event requires a series of conversations with Mark and Jennifer. Every other day of the week Mark or Jennifer are working the item shop. You can not have the required conversation with them if they are working at the item shop. So, you must leave and re-enter *Domina* many times to complete this event.

Enter *Domina*. Go to Mark's place (lower left door in center of town; they are on the very top floor) talk to Mark and Rachel (if Mark is not in the same room as Rachel, exit out to the World Map and re-enter *Domina* immediately. Then go back up stairs and he should be there.). Exit out to the World Map and enter *Domina* again. Go talk to Jennifer in the Marketplace (she should be near the fortune teller lady). Exit out to the World Map and enter *Domina* again. Go back and talk to Mark to find that Rachel left. Talk to Teapo and she'll tell you she went to the Academy of Magic in *Geo*.

Enter *Geo* and go to the academy library on Salamander Day (sleep at the caf√© to change days). See the flash of light.

Enter *Domina* and go back to talk to Rachel and Mark. Exit out to the World Map and enter *Domina* again. Go back and talk to Jennifer in the Marketplace. Exit out to the World Map and enter *Domina* again. Go back and talk to Mark and Rachel to end the Event.
