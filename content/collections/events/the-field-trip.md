Place the Dragon Bone AF in the space directly to the Left of the *Norn Peaks* to create the *Bone Fortress*. Enter the *Bone Fortress*.

Talk to the student in the middle of the screen. You need to get 3 ingredients from the students in the next area. Go Right. The student in blue along at the top has the Faerie Scales. The male Flowerling in the Lower Right has the Starsparkles. A purple Flowerling near the Middle Right side has the Silver Spotted Mushrooms. Take the ingredients back to the student in the first area to end the Event.
