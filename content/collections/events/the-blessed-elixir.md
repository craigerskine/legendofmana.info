Enter *Geo*.

Go to the Bar area and talk to the bartender. Exit out to the World Map.

Enter *Gato Grottoes* and go to the Dungeons in the western section of the map. Enter the first door on the Left and continue through the dungeons until you find a room with a bunch of barrels and some nuns. Talk to the nuns to trigger the event and leave the room.

Now you get a chance to beat the snot out of Niccolo. Wee Hoo!

Enter *Geo* and talk to the bartender again.

Enter *Lumina* and talk to the bartender in the western section.

Enter the *Duma Desert* and work your way through the areas until you find the spring.

Watch the barrel fill up with water and you are done with this Event.
