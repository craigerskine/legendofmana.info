Enter *Lumina*. Go to the Tavern in the western section and talk to Capella and Diddle. Leave and return to that area to have Diddle leave. Return home and go back out to the World Map to have four Shadoles enter *Lumina*.

Go back to *Lumina* and talk to Capella. He will leave. Leave the area and watch Diddle get taken hostage.

Enter *Underworld* and you'll be teleported to the lowest level.

*DON'T TALK TO POKIEHL* or you may fail this Event.

Chase Capella and Diddle but do not touch any of the Shadoles or you will teleport back to the beginning. Follow these instructions:

* Left
* Go through two groups of the Shadoles
* Go through two long rooms
* Go past the Shadoles that disappear (Be careful, they are still there)
* Go past the Shadoles that disappear (note the locations)

Defeat the Ape Mummy to end this Event. Be sure to not enter *Domina* after this event, just go directly Home and move on to the next Event.
