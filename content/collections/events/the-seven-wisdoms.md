You already started this event but here is how you finish it:

*Wisdom 1: Gaeus* Take Bud to the *Luon Highway* and talk to the hippo-like creature(Boink). Have him teleport you to the fork and keep going right to find Gaeus.

*Wisdom 2: Tote* Take Bud to *Lake Kilma* and head to the cliff to find Tote the turtle.

*Wisdom 3: Rosiotti* Take Bud to the *Jungle* and use the psychic service to go to the Forest Ruins. Go up from that screen to get to Rosiotti.

*Wisdom 4: Pokiehl* You already did this one.

*Wisdom 5: Olbohn* Take Bud to *Underworld* and touch the stone. Go left, upper right, right, up, up, upper right, lower left and far right. Go in the door to get to Olbohn. To get back out talk to the Shadole and have it bring you to the entrance. Talk to the Shadole there to have him take you to the surface.

*Wisdom 6: Selva* Take Bud to *Gato Grottoes*. If you have talked to the other 5 Wisdoms, Selva will be at the fork right before the Temple of Healing.

Bring Bud back home to end this event.
