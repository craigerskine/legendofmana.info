Place the Sword of Mana in the space directly to above *Domina* to create the *Tree of Mana*. Do not enter the *Tree of Mana* yet. Instead, enter *Domina*.

Go to the center of town and you'll see a duplicate of yourself doing bad stuff to a Sproutling. Go Right to the market. It will happen again. Go back to the center of town and talk to Teapo in the Lower Left door near the exit. Exit out of the building and follow your duplicate to the Outskirts of *Domina*. It will turn into Shadow Zero-One and you will need to defeat it.
