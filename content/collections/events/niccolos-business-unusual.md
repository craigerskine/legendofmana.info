Place the Colorblocks AF in the space directly above your Home to create *Domina*. Enter *Domina* you will see a little conversation at the top of the screen... ignore it for now and leave this first area through the top path.

In the next area you will see a crazy looking Rabbit/Cat character named Niccolo. Talk to him, tell him you are *Not Afraid* of the bandits, and tell him *Yes* when he asks you to help him. You have now started your first event!

Niccolo asks you to take him to see Teapo. Go back to the center of town near the entrance to *Domina* and enter the bottom-most door of the building in the lower left. Teapo is the one that looks like a "tea pot". Talk to him and Niccolo will give you the Wheel AF.

After the conversation, exit the building and exit the area through the bottom path. Exit out to the World Map and place the Wheel AF directly to the left of your Home to create *Luon Highway*. Enter *Luon Highway*.

Proceed through *Luon Highway* with the following directions:

* Right
* Right
* Upper Right at Fork
* Right
* Right

When prompted choose *Throw Candy* and get ready to begin your first Boss fight. After you win you will get some useless items from Niccolo and then he should give you the Flame and Medallion AF's.
