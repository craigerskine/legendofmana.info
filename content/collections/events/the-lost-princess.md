Enter *Domina*. Go into the Pub and talk to the guy(Elazul) staring at the girl(Rachel). Side with Elazul to have him join you. Talk to Rachel again and she will give you the Jade Egg AF. If you choose to stick up for Rachel then Elazul will leave. Exit out to the *Domina* Map and Elazul should pop up and ask you if he can go with you. It doesn't matter what you say, he will automatically join. If Elazul does not show up, re-enter and exit *Domina* until he does.

Place the Jade Egg AF in the space directly above the *Junkyard* to create the *Mekiv Caverns*. Enter the *Mekiv Caverns*.
