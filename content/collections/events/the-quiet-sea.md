Go to the Captain's Quarters and talk to him at the top of the screen. Go to the Forecastle Deck and go down the stairs. Go into the left door on the top wall. Go downstairs and search the barrel. Tell him that there is a pretty girl and keep talking until he gives you the bottle. Return to the top deck and fight Gova.
