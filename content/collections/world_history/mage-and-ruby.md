Magnolia lost her life in the hut as it burned down, but the doll was saved. The doll began to call herself Magnolia, and she stayed with the Lilipeas, until one day she left with a mage. The mage wanted to steal the Eyes of Flame in Magnolia's eyes, for they contained more Mana energy than the enchanted instruments.
