The Moon Gods tried to outdo each other in creating beauty. Sometimes they argued trying follow the Mana Goddess's will and create many beasts. But dark clouds came to Fa'Diel, and the Moon Gods created greater beasts, and set them loose upon the land. The Flammies often quarreled, and the cycle of creation and destruction repeated endlessly.
