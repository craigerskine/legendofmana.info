Nunuzac was Lonway's best and the most powerful summoner. He summoned Freymold, the Wyrm of Fire, as Lonway ordered him when the tide of war began to turn against him. Nunuzac kept summoning monsters until Lonway was killed, and he himself became trapped in the dimension on the other side of his magic circle.
