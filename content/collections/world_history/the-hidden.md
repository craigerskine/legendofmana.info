Although the Faeries thought that all humans were enemies, they soon discovered that there were those in the land of men who could understand the Faeries. With the help of the humans, they were again able to battle Anise and her mages. Eventually they rose victorious. Unfortunately, during the fight, the Mana Tree burned to the ground.
