In the Age of Myth, the stones that the Mana Goddess gave to the Moon Gods were the most powerful source of magic known. However, some powerful magic users born in later ages possessed similar stones. Anise tried to obtain such a stone when she created the Eye of Flame, but it was difficult to control, and very dangerous.
