The angels gave up on retrieving Janna, and chose to fight for the Jumi. With help from the Wisdoms, they built a ship to confront Janna, and joined the war. The angels defeated the leader of humans and Zuf'ben, who had become an evil Faerie, and sealed Janna in the dimensional gap. Then they remained in Fa'Diel.
