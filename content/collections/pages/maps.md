There's a ton of configurations that you can use to complete The Legend of Mana and get all of the goodies along the way. For this [Walkthrough](/walkthrough/events/) I have chosen the __'Round the Tree Again__ map configuration from the "Map/Artifact Placement Guide, version 2.5" found at [GameFaqs](http://gamefaqs.com/ps/256525-legend-of-mana/faqs/10037).

To place your AF's (Artifacts) efficiently you will need to pick a very specific location on the play area.

## Artifact Order

If you are following the included [Walkthrough](/walkthrough/events/), you should place your lands in the order listed below. This Land Placement Guide allows you to obtain the following (if you follow the event order exactly as [listed](/walkthrough/events/)):

* Access to all Events
* Access to all Mineral [Shops](/encyclopedias/shops/)
* Access to all [Demi-Human](/encyclopedias/monsters-pets/demi-human/) Pets
* Highest level Weapon Shops
* Full Mana Levels in Orchard
* [Wimpy Thugling](/walkthrough/events/the-wimpy-thugling/) Event
